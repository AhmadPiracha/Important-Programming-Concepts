Sure, I'll try to explain the OOP concepts you mentioned. Here's a brief overview:

2) **Pillars of OOP**: The four pillars of OOP are **Abstraction**, **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**. These concepts help in designing and implementing software systems that are modular, extensible, and maintainable.

3) **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class. This can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

4) **Types of Polymorphism**: There are two types of polymorphism: **Compile-time Polymorphism** and **Runtime Polymorphism**. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through function overloading, while runtime polymorphism is achieved through function overriding.

5) **Runtime Polymorphism vs Compile-time Polymorphism**: Runtime polymorphism is achieved when the method call is resolved at runtime based on the actual type of the object. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved when the method call is resolved at compile time based on the number, types, and order of arguments passed to the method.

6) **Scenario for Runtime and Compile-time Polymorphism**: Consider a scenario where we have a base class called `Shape` and two derived classes called `Circle` and `Rectangle`. Both derived classes have a method called `draw()`. At compile time, the compiler checks whether the method exists in the base class or not. At runtime, when we create an object of either `Circle` or `Rectangle`, the appropriate `draw()` method is called based on the actual type of the object.

7) **Operator Overloading**: Operator overloading allows operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc., to be overloaded so that they can be used with user-defined data types such as classes or structures.

8) **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviors of another class. The class that inherits properties is called a derived class or subclass, while the class whose properties are inherited is called a base class or superclass.

9) **Types of Inheritance**: There are five types of inheritance: **Single Inheritance**, **Multiple Inheritance**, **Multilevel Inheritance**, **Hierarchical Inheritance**, and **Hybrid Inheritance**.

10) **Difference between Struct and Class**: The main difference between a struct and a class in C++ is that members of a struct are public by default, while members of a class are private by default.

11) **Difference between Inheritance and Association**: Inheritance is an "is-a" relationship between two classes, while association is a "has-a" relationship between two classes.

12) **Composition and Association**: Composition and association are two types of relationships between classes in OOP. Composition represents a "has-a" relationship where one class owns another class, while association represents a "uses-a" relationship where one class uses another class.

13) **Difference between Garbage Collector and Finalize Keyword**: Garbage collector is an automatic memory management system that frees up memory that is no longer being used by an application. Finalize keyword is used to perform cleanup operations before an object is destroyed by garbage collector.

14) **Friend Functions**: Friend functions are non-member functions that have access to private or protected members of a class. They are declared inside the class with the keyword `friend`.

15) **Diamond Problem**: The diamond problem occurs when two classes inherit from a common base class, and a third class inherits from both these classes. This creates ambiguity as to which version of the inherited member function should be used.

16) **Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy**: Shallow copy creates a new object which stores references to the original object's member variables. Deep copy creates a new object with its own copy of all member variables.
