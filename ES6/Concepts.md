Certainly! Here's a more comprehensive list of concepts introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) JavaScript:

1. **Block-Scoped Declarations**:
   - `let` and `const` for block-scoped variables and constants.
   - Block-scoped function declarations (with limitations).

2. **Arrow Functions**:
   - Concise syntax for writing functions.
   - Lexical scoping of `this` within arrow functions.

3. **Template Literals**:
   - Backticks (\`) for creating template strings.
   - Embedded expressions using `${}`.

4. **Destructuring**:
   - Extracting values from arrays and objects into variables.
   - Default values and renaming variables.

5. **Default Parameters**:
   - Setting default values for function parameters.

6. **Rest and Spread Operators**:
   - `...` for spreading elements of an iterable (e.g., array, string) into another iterable.
   - Collecting function arguments into an array using rest parameter.

7. **Classes**:
   - Class syntax for creating objects and constructors.
   - Methods, getters, setters, and inheritance using `extends`.

8. **Modules**:
   - `import` and `export` for creating modular code.
   - Different types of exports (`default`, named).

9. **Promises**:
   - Improved asynchronous programming using promises.
   - `Promise` object for representing a value that might be available now, in the future, or never.
   - `then`, `catch`, and `finally` methods for handling promise states.

10. **Async/Await**:
    - `async` functions for asynchronous programming.
    - `await` keyword for pausing the execution until a promise is resolved or rejected.

11. **Symbol**:
    - A new primitive data type representing a unique identifier.
    - Useful for creating private object properties, among other things.

12. **Map and Set**:
    - `Map` for storing key-value pairs with any data type as keys.
    - `Set` for storing unique values.

13. **Iterators and Generators**:
    - `Symbol.iterator` for creating custom iterators.
    - `Generator` functions for creating iterators in a more readable way.

14. **Proxy and Reflect**:
    - `Proxy` for intercepting operations on objects.
    - `Reflect` for accessing object-related operations in a more consistent way.

15. **Array and Object Enhancements**:
    - `Array.from()` for creating arrays from array-like objects.
    - `Array.of()` for creating arrays with specified values.
    - Array methods like `find`, `findIndex`, `includes`, and more.
    - Object property shorthand and computed property names.

16. **String Enhancements**:
    - String methods like `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `includes`, and more.
    - Template literals for multiline strings and variable interpolation.

17. **Math and Number Enhancements**:
    - Math methods like `Math.sign`, `Math.trunc`, `Math.pow`, and more.
    - Number properties like `Number.EPSILON`, `Number.isNaN`, `Number.isFinite`, etc.

18. **Object-Oriented Programming Enhancements**:
    - `Object.assign()` for merging objects.
    - `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` for iterating over object properties.

19. **Proxying and Reflection**:
    - The `Proxy` object for intercepting and customizing operations on objects.
    - The `Reflect` object for accessing object-related operations in a more controlled way.

20. **Typed Arrays**:
    - Arrays of various numeric types to work with binary data efficiently.

21. **Global Object Enhancements**:
    - New methods on the `global` object, such as `isFinite`, `isNaN`, `parseInt`, and `parseFloat`.

22. **Modules**:
    - Declarative syntax for defining and importing/exporting modules.
    - Support for asynchronous module loading using `import()`.

Remember that while ECMAScript 6 introduced these features, JavaScript has continued to evolve with subsequent versions, bringing even more enhancements and features.
