In JavaScript, promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations. 
They represent a value that may not be available yet, but will be at some point in the future. 
Promises have three states: "pending," "fulfilled," and "rejected." 
You can use them with the `.then()` and `.catch()` methods to handle successful and failed outcomes of asynchronous tasks.
Starting with ES6, JavaScript also introduced the `async/await` syntax, which simplifies working with promises by allowing you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous style.
