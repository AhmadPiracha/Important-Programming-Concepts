ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a significant update to the JavaScript programming language. It introduced many new features and improvements aimed at making JavaScript code more expressive, readable, and maintainable. Some of the notable features introduced in ES6 include:

1. **Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing anonymous functions. They also inherit the `this` value from the enclosing context.

   ```javascript
   // Traditional function
   function add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }

   // Arrow function
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

2. **Let and Const**: `let` and `const` introduced block-scoped variable declarations. `let` allows reassignment, while `const` creates variables that cannot be reassigned.

   ```javascript
   let x = 5;
   const PI = 3.14159;
   ```

3. **Template Literals**: Template literals allow embedding expressions and variables directly into strings using backticks (`).

   ```javascript
   const name = "Alice";
   console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   ```

4. **Destructuring Assignment**: Destructuring enables extracting values from arrays and objects into variables using a concise syntax.

   ```javascript
   const [a, b] = [1, 2];
   const { firstName, lastName } = person;
   ```

5. **Default Parameters**: ES6 allows specifying default values for function parameters.

   ```javascript
   function greet(name = "Guest") {
       console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   }
   ```

6. **Spread and Rest Operators**: The spread operator (`...`) is used to split an array or object into individual elements, while the rest operator is used to bundle multiple function arguments into an array.

   ```javascript
   const arr = [1, 2, 3];
   const newArr = [...arr, 4, 5];

   function sum(...numbers) {
       return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
   }
   ```

7. **Classes**: ES6 introduced a more structured syntax for creating classes and working with inheritance.

   ```javascript
   class Animal {
       constructor(name) {
           this.name = name;
       }
       speak() {
           console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       speak() {
           console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
       }
   }
   ```

8. **Modules**: ES6 modules provide a standardized way to organize and share code between files. You can use `import` and `export` statements to manage dependencies.

   ```javascript
   // in math.js
   export function square(x) {
       return x * x;
   }

   // in main.js
   import { square } from './math';
   ```

9. **Promises**: Promises offer a more elegant way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks.

   ```javascript
   function fetchData() {
       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
           // Fetch data asynchronously
           if (dataIsAvailable) {
               resolve(data);
           } else {
               reject("Data not available.");
           }
       });
   }
   ```

10. **Async/Await**: Async functions and the `await` keyword simplify working with promises, making asynchronous code look more like synchronous code.

    ```javascript
    async function getData() {
        try {
            const response = await fetchData();
            console.log(response);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(error);
        }
    }
    ```

These are just some of the key features introduced in ES6. Subsequent ECMAScript versions have continued to bring additional improvements and features to the language.
