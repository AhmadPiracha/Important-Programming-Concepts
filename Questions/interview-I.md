Absolutely! Here are the responses and C++ code examples for each concept that might be useful for your online interview.

### OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

#### 1. OOP 4 Concepts

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data with methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
  ```cpp
  class Encapsulated {
  private:
      int data;
  public:
      void setData(int d) { data = d; }
      int getData() { return data; }
  };
  ```

- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts.
  ```cpp
  class AbstractExample {
  public:
      virtual void display() = 0; // Pure virtual function
  };

  class ConcreteExample : public AbstractExample {
  public:
      void display() override { cout << "Displaying" << endl; }
  };
  ```

- **Inheritance**: Mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class.
  ```cpp
  class Base {
  public:
      void display() { cout << "Base Display" << endl; }
  };

  class Derived : public Base {
  public:
      void display() { cout << "Derived Display" << endl; }
  };
  ```

- **Polymorphism**: Ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It includes method overriding and method overloading.
  ```cpp
  class Base {
  public:
      virtual void show() { cout << "Base class" << endl; }
  };

  class Derived : public Base {
  public:
      void show() override { cout << "Derived class" << endl; }
  };

  void demonstratePolymorphism(Base &b) {
      b.show();
  }
  ```

#### 2. Aggregation vs Composition

- **Aggregation**: A special form of association where the child can exist independently of the parent.
  ```cpp
  class Engine {
  public:
      void start() { cout << "Engine started" << endl; }
  };

  class Car {
  private:
      Engine* engine; // Car has an Engine
  public:
      Car(Engine* e) : engine(e) {}
      void startCar() { engine->start(); }
  };

  int main() {
      Engine* engine = new Engine();
      Car car(engine);
      car.startCar();
      delete engine;
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- **Composition**: A strong form of aggregation where the child cannot exist independently of the parent.
  ```cpp
  class Engine {
  public:
      void start() { cout << "Engine started" << endl; }
  };

  class Car {
  private:
      Engine engine; // Car owns Engine, no Engine outside Car
  public:
      Car() {}
      void startCar() { engine.start(); }
  };

  int main() {
      Car car;
      car.startCar();
      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 3. Diamond Problem (Why Diamond Problem Doesn't Exist in JAVA)

- **Diamond Problem**: Occurs in multiple inheritance when two classes B and C inherit from A and class D inherits from both B and C.
- **Java Solution**: Java avoids the diamond problem by not supporting multiple inheritance of classes. Instead, it uses interfaces to achieve multiple inheritances.

#### 4. Function Overloading vs Function Overriding

- **Function Overloading**: Same function name with different parameters within the same class.
  ```cpp
  class Print {
  public:
      void display(int i) { cout << "Integer: " << i << endl; }
      void display(double f) { cout << "Double: " << f << endl; }
  };
  ```

- **Function Overriding**: Same function name and parameters in a base class and a derived class.
  ```cpp
  class Base {
  public:
      virtual void show() { cout << "Base class" << endl; }
  };

  class Derived : public Base {
  public:
      void show() override { cout << "Derived class" << endl; }
  };
  ```

#### 5. Which Operator Used To Solve Diamond Problem

- **Operator**: Not applicable, as Java solves the diamond problem through interface inheritance.

#### 6. Operator Overloading (How To Overload cin>>, cout<< operators) (What operators we can't overload)

- **Operator Overloading**:
  ```cpp
  class Complex {
  private:
      float real, imag;
  public:
      friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Complex& c);
      friend istream& operator>>(istream& is, Complex& c);
  };

  ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Complex& c) {
      os << c.real << " + " << c.imag << "i";
      return os;
  }

  istream& operator>>(istream& is, Complex& c) {
      is >> c.real >> c.imag;
      return is;
  }

  int main() {
      Complex c;
      cout << "Enter complex number (real and imaginary parts): ";
      cin >> c;
      cout << "You entered: " << c << endl;
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- **Non-overloadable operators**: `::`, `.*`, `.`, `?:`

#### 7. What are static variables, when they get initialized where they exist in memory?

- **Static Variables**: Variables shared among all instances of a class.
  - **Initialization**: At the time of class loading.
  - **Memory Location**: Stored in the data segment.

  ```cpp
  class Example {
  public:
      static int count;
  };

  int Example::count = 0; // Initialization

  int main() {
      cout << "Initial count: " << Example::count << endl;
      Example::count++;
      cout << "Updated count: " << Example::count << endl;
      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 8. What is the Sequence of Calling Constructors and Destructors?

- **Sequence**:
  - Constructors: Base class constructor -> Derived class constructor.
  - Destructors: Derived class destructor -> Base class destructor.

  ```cpp
  class Base {
  public:
      Base() { cout << "Base Constructor" << endl; }
      ~Base() { cout << "Base Destructor" << endl; }
  };

  class Derived : public Base {
  public:
      Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor" << endl; }
      ~Derived() { cout << "Derived Destructor" << endl; }
  };

  int main() {
      Derived d;
      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 9. Static & Dynamic Polymorphism

- **Static Polymorphism**: Compile-time polymorphism achieved through method overloading and operator overloading.
  ```cpp
  class Print {
  public:
      void display(int i) { cout << "Integer: " << i << endl; }
      void display(double f) { cout << "Double: " << f << endl; }
  };
  ```

- **Dynamic Polymorphism**: Runtime polymorphism achieved through method overriding using virtual functions.
  ```cpp
  class Base {
  public:
      virtual void show() { cout << "Base class" << endl; }
  };

  class Derived : public Base {
  public:
      void show() override { cout << "Derived class" << endl; }
  };

  void demonstratePolymorphism(Base &b) {
      b.show();
  }

  int main() {
      Base b;
      Derived d;
      demonstratePolymorphism(b); // Outputs "Base class"
      demonstratePolymorphism(d); // Outputs "Derived class"
      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 10. Abstract class & Abstract methods

- **Abstract Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods.
- **Abstract Method**: A method without implementation, meant to be overridden in derived classes.

  ```cpp
  class AbstractExample {
  public:
      virtual void display() = 0; // Pure virtual function
  };

  class ConcreteExample : public AbstractExample {
  public:
      void display() override { cout << "Displaying" << endl; }
  };

  int main() {
      ConcreteExample obj;
      obj.display(); // Outputs "Displaying"
      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 11. How to write a definition of the abstract method

  ```cpp
  class AbstractExample {
  public:
      virtual void display() = 0; // Pure virtual function
  };

  class ConcreteExample : public AbstractExample {
  public:
      void display() override { cout << "Displaying" << endl; }
  };
  ```

#### 12. Difference between Abstract Class and Interface

- **Abstract Class**:
  - Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
  - Supports single inheritance.
  - Can have member variables.

- **Interface**:
  - Can only have abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default methods).
  - Supports multiple inheritance.
  - Cannot have member variables (only constants).

  ```cpp
  class AbstractClass {
  public:
      virtual void method1() = 0;
      void method2() { cout << "Non-abstract method" << endl; }
  };

  class Interface {
  public:
      virtual void method1() = 0;
  };

  class Implementation : public AbstractClass, public Interface {
  public:
      void method1() override { cout << "Implemented method" << endl; }
  };
  ```

#### 13. Compiler vs Interpreter (Which one is better &

 why)

- **Compiler**: Translates the entire source code into machine code before execution. Generally faster execution but longer compile times.
- **Interpreter**: Translates source code line-by-line during execution. Slower execution but quicker to start.

  - **Better**: Depends on use-case. For performance-critical applications, compilers are better. For development and scripting, interpreters are more flexible.

#### 14. Stack vs Heap in Memory (Which variables store in stack and which stores in heap)

- **Stack**: Memory for static memory allocation. Stores local variables and function call information.
- **Heap**: Memory for dynamic memory allocation. Stores objects and data requiring dynamic lifetime.

  ```cpp
  int main() {
      int stackVar = 10; // Stored in stack
      int* heapVar = new int(20); // Stored in heap
      delete heapVar; // Free memory
      return 0;
  }
  ```

#### 15. What are the access modifiers?

- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.
- **Protected**: Accessible within the class and derived classes.
- **Private**: Accessible only within the class.

  ```cpp
  class AccessModifiers {
  public:
      int publicVar;
  protected:
      int protectedVar;
  private:
      int privateVar;
  };
  ```

#### 16. What are primitive data types?

- **Primitive Data Types**: Basic types provided by a programming language. In C++, these include `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `bool`, etc.

  ```cpp
  int a = 10;
  char b = 'A';
  float c = 10.5f;
  double d = 20.5;
  bool e = true;
  ```

#### 17. Wrapper classes in JAVA

- **Wrapper Classes**: Provide a way to use primitive data types as objects. Examples: `Integer`, `Character`, `Double`, etc.

### Data Structures

#### 1. How many data structures are available.

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, Heaps, etc.

#### 2. Array vs LinkedList

- **Array**: Fixed size, contiguous memory, O(1) access time, O(n) insertion/deletion.
- **LinkedList**: Dynamic size, non-contiguous memory, O(n) access time, O(1) insertion/deletion.

  ```cpp
  // Array
  int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  // Linked List
  struct Node {
      int data;
      Node* next;
  };
  ```

#### 3. Stack vs Queue

- **Stack**: LIFO (Last In First Out).
- **Queue**: FIFO (First In First Out).

  ```cpp
  // Stack
  stack<int> stk;
  stk.push(1);
  stk.pop();

  // Queue
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(1);
  q.pop();
  ```

#### 4. Tree vs Graph

- **Tree**: A hierarchical structure with a single root, no cycles.
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes with arbitrary connections, may have cycles.

  ```cpp
  // Tree Node
  struct TreeNode {
      int data;
      TreeNode* left;
      TreeNode* right;
  };

  // Graph using adjacency list
  class Graph {
  private:
      int V;
      list<int> *adj;
  public:
      Graph(int V);
      void addEdge(int v, int w);
  };
  ```

#### 5. How to find a cycle in a graph

  ```cpp
  bool isCyclicUtil(int v, bool visited[], bool *recStack, list<int> adj[]) {
      if (!visited[v]) {
          visited[v] = true;
          recStack[v] = true;
          for (int neighbor : adj[v]) {
              if (!visited[neighbor] && isCyclicUtil(neighbor, visited, recStack, adj))
                  return true;
              else if (recStack[neighbor])
                  return true;
          }
      }
      recStack[v] = false;
      return false;
  }

  bool isCyclic(Graph& graph, int V) {
      bool *visited = new bool[V];
      bool *recStack = new bool[V];
      for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
          visited[i] = false;
          recStack[i] = false;
      }
      for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
          if (isCyclicUtil(i, visited, recStack, graph.adj))
              return true;
      return false;
  }
  ```

#### 6. Recursion (Most important)

- **Recursion**: A function that calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.

  ```cpp
  int factorial(int n) {
      if (n <= 1) return 1;
      else return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
  ```

#### 7. Find factorial in recursion.

  ```cpp
  int factorial(int n) {
      if (n <= 1) return 1;
      else return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
  ```

#### 8. Sorting Algorithms (All available on GeeksforGeeks)

- **Examples**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.

#### 9. Binary Search (Important for optimal searching)

  ```cpp
  int binarySearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int x) {
      while (left <= right) {
          int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
          if (arr[mid] == x) return mid;
          if (arr[mid] < x) left = mid + 1;
          else right = mid - 1;
      }
      return -1;
  }
  ```

#### 10. Make a balance BST from the sorted array.

  ```cpp
  struct Node {
      int data;
      Node* left;
      Node* right;
      Node(int d) : data(d), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
  };

  Node* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
      if (start > end) return NULL;
      int mid = (start + end) / 2;
      Node* node = new Node(nums[mid]);
      node->left = sortedArrayToBST(nums, start, mid - 1);
      node->right = sortedArrayToBST(nums, mid + 1, end);
      return node;
  }
  ```

#### 11. Strings (Basic operations like reverse, check if palindrome or not, count a character frequency)

- **Reverse**:
  ```cpp
  string reverseString(string s) {
      reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
      return s;
  }
  ```

- **Check if Palindrome**:
  ```cpp
  bool isPalindrome(string s) {
      int l = 0, r = s.size() - 1;
      while (l < r) {
          if (s[l] != s[r]) return false;
          l++;
          r--;
      }
      return true;
  }
  ```

- **Count Character Frequency**:
  ```cpp
  unordered_map<char, int> countFrequency(string s) {
      unordered_map<char, int> freq;
      for (char c : s) freq[c]++;
      return freq;
  }
  ```

#### 12. BFS, DFS, Graph traverse algorithms

- **BFS**:
  ```cpp
  void BFS(int start, vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
      queue<int> q;
      vector<bool> visited(adj.size(), false);
      q.push(start);
      visited[start] = true;
      while (!q.empty()) {
          int node = q.front();
          q.pop();
          cout << node << " ";
          for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
              if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                  q.push(neighbor);
                  visited[neighbor] = true;
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- **DFS**:
  ```cpp
  void DFS(int node, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited) {
      visited[node] = true;
      cout << node << " ";
      for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
          if (!visited[neighbor]) {
              DFS(neighbor, adj, visited);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### Database

- **Foreign Key**: Key used to link two tables.
- **Candidate Key**: A column, or set of columns, that can qualify as a primary key.
- **Composite Key**: A key composed of two or more columns.

#### 3. Truncate vs Delete

- **Truncate**: Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions. Faster, cannot be rolled back.
- **Delete**: Removes rows one at a time and logs each deletion. Can be rolled back.

#### 4. Indexing (Concept, Advantages, and Disadvantages)

- **Indexing**: A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval.
  - **Advantages**: Faster searches, improved performance for queries.
  - **Disadvantages**: Requires additional storage,

 slower writes due to index updates.

#### 5. SQL Injection

- **SQL Injection**: A code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application’s software to execute arbitrary SQL code.
  - **Prevention**: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, and input validation.

#### 6. How to store password & username in the database

- **Storing Passwords**: Use hashing (e.g., bcrypt) and salting to store passwords securely.
  - **Username**: Store as plain text with proper encoding and sanitization.

#### 7. JOINS (Most important)

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN**: Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

#### 8. Joins vs Sub-Queries

- **Joins**: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
- **Sub-Queries**: A query nested inside another query.

#### 9. Relational Database (Concept and Method)

- **Relational Database**: A database structured to recognize relations among stored items of information.
  - **Method**: Uses tables (relations) to store data, which can be queried using SQL.

#### 10. What is a transaction block

- **Transaction Block**: A sequence of database operations treated as a single unit. All operations within the transaction must be completed successfully for the transaction to be committed.

  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  -- SQL operations
  COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK;
  ```
