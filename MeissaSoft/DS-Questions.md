1. **How many data structures are available**: There are numerous data structures available, ranging from basic structures like arrays and linked lists to more complex ones like trees, graphs, and hash tables. The specific number is not fixed as new data structures may be designed to suit specific needs.

2. **Array vs LinkedList**: Arrays offer fast access to elements by index but have a fixed size, while linked lists allow for dynamic sizing and efficient insertions/deletions. The choice depends on the specific use case.

3. **Stack vs Queue**: Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and are used for tasks like function call management. Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle and are used in scenarios like task scheduling.

4. **Tree vs Graph**: Trees are a specific type of graph with a hierarchical structure. Trees have a root node and branches, while graphs are more general and can have cycles and different types of connections between nodes.

5. **How to find a cycle in a graph**: Detecting cycles in a graph can be done using various algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS) or algorithms like Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (cycle detection in linked lists).

6. **Recursion (Most important)**: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's important for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

7. **Find factorial in recursion**: You can find the factorial of a number using a recursive function. For example, in Python:

   ```python
   def factorial(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 1
       else:
           return n * factorial(n - 1)
   ```

8. **Sorting Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and others are used to arrange data in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending).

9. **Binary Search (Important for optimal searching)**: Binary search is a search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It efficiently finds the position of a target value within the array.

10. **Make a balanced BST from the sorted array**: You can create a balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) from a sorted array by selecting the middle element as the root and recursively constructing the left and right subtrees.

11. **Strings (Basic operations like reverse, check if palindrome or not, count character frequency)**: These are common string manipulation tasks. For example, reversing a string in Python can be done using `string[::-1]`, and checking for palindromes involves comparing the string with its reverse.

12. **BFS, DFS, Graph traverse algorithms**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are algorithms used to traverse graphs. BFS explores nodes level by level, while DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

These topics are fundamental in computer science and programming and are important for understanding data structures and algorithms, which are essential in software development and problem-solving.
