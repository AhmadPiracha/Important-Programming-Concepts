**1. Abstraction**:
Abstraction is the process of hiding complex details while showing only the necessary parts. Consider a remote control as a real-life example. You don't need to understand how the TV works internally; you only need to interact with the remote's buttons. Here's a simple Python example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class RemoteControl(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def power_on(self):
        pass

class TV(RemoteControl):
    def power_on(self):
        print("TV is powered on.")

class DVDPlayer(RemoteControl):
    def power_on(self):
        print("DVD player is powered on.")

tv_remote = TV()
tv_remote.power_on()

dvd_remote = DVDPlayer()
dvd_remote.power_on()
```

**2. Encapsulation**:
Encapsulation is about restricting access to an object's internal state. A bank account is a classic example. You hide the balance and allow controlled access through methods. Here's a C# example:

```csharp
class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance;

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount <= balance)
        {
            balance -= amount;
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Insufficient funds.");
        }
    }

    public decimal GetBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }
}

BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.Deposit(1000);
account.Withdraw(500);
Console.WriteLine("Balance: " + account.GetBalance());
```

**3. Inheritance**:
Inheritance is where one class inherits properties and behaviors from another. Think of a base class `Vehicle` and derived classes like `Car` and `Bicycle`. Here's a Java example:

```java
class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle started.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving.");
    }
}

class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
    void pedal() {
        System.out.println("Bicycle is pedaling.");
    }
}

Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.start();
myCar.drive();

Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle();
myBike.start();
myBike.pedal();
```

**4. Polymorphism**:
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class. Consider the `draw` method in a base class `Shape` and override it in derived classes like `Circle` and `Rectangle`. Here's a Python example:

```python
class Shape:
    def draw(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing a circle")

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing a rectangle")

shapes = [Circle(), Rectangle()]

for shape in shapes:
    shape.draw()
```

**5. Runtime Polymorphism vs. Compile-time Polymorphism**:
Runtime polymorphism occurs when method resolution happens at runtime based on the actual object's type. Compile-time polymorphism happens when method resolution is determined at compile time based on the method signature. You can use the same code example for Polymorphism to illustrate this.

**6. Scenario for Runtime and Compile-time Polymorphism**:
Consider a scenario where we have a base class `Bird` with two derived classes `Sparrow` and `Penguin`. Both have a `sound()` method, but the actual sound produced differs. At runtime, calling `sound()` on a `Bird` object will produce the sound specific to the actual type of bird.

**7. Operator Overloading**:
Operator overloading allows operators to be used with user-defined data types. Think of operator overloading for complex numbers in C++:

```cpp
class Complex {
private:
    double real;
    double imag;

public:
    Complex(double r, double i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    Complex operator + (const Complex& other) {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }
};

Complex a(2.0, 3.0);
Complex b(1.5, 2.5);
Complex c = a + b;  // Operator overloading for addition
```

**8. Inheritance Types**:
Explore different inheritance types with a real-life analogy. For example, consider the hierarchy of vehicles with single inheritance, multiple inheritance, etc.

**9. Difference between Struct and Class**:
In C++, a struct is like a class but with members public by default. Think of a class as a blueprint for an object with private members and a struct as a simple data structure. Here's an example:

```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int privateData;

public:
    int publicData;
};

struct MyStruct {
    int publicData;
};

```

**10. Difference between Inheritance and Association**:
Inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship, while association represents a "has-a" relationship. Consider a class `Car` inheriting from a class `Vehicle` (inheritance), and a class `Library` having a reference to a class `Book` (association).

**11. Composition and Association**:
Composition represents a "has-a" relationship with ownership, where one class is a part of another (e.g., a car has an engine). Association represents a "uses-a" relationship, where one class uses another without ownership (e.g., a library uses books).

**12. Difference between Garbage Collector and Finalize Keyword**:
In Java, the Garbage Collector automatically reclaims memory when an object is no longer in use. The `finalize` method allows you to perform cleanup operations before an object is garbage collected.

**13. Friend Functions**:
Friend functions are non-member functions that have access to a class's private or protected members. You can think of it as a trusted friend who can access your private information. Here's a C++ example:

```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int data;

public:
    MyClass(int d) : data(d) {}

    friend void showData(MyClass obj);
};

void showData(MyClass obj) {
    std::cout << "Data: " << obj.data << std::endl;
}

MyClass myObj(42);
showData(myObj);
```

**14. Diamond Problem**:
The diamond problem occurs when multiple classes inherit from a common base class, and a class inherits from these multiple classes. This can create ambiguity. Here's a C++ example with a real-life analogy:

```cpp
class LivingBeing {
public:
    void eat() {
        std::cout << "LivingBeing is eating." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Animal : public LivingBeing {};

class Plant : public LivingBeing {};

class Herbivore : public Animal, public Plant {};

int main() {
    Herbivore h;
    h.eat(); // Ambiguity - should Herbivore eat like an animal or a plant?
    return 0;
}
```

**15. Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy**:
Consider a class `Person` with a `name` and an object `address` that contains more details. Shallow copy would copy references, while deep copy
