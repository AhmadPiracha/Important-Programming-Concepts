There is a bird on the front side of the first train which moves towards the second train and returns back when the bird reached the front of the second train. The bird's speed is 70km/h. What will be the total distance covered by the bird when both trains will collide?

9. Two trains are moving towards each other with a speed of 200KM/h. There is a distance of 400km between them. There is a bird on the front side of the first train which moves towards the second train and returns back when the bird reached the front of the second train. The bird's speed is 393.75km/h. What will be the total distance covered by the bird when both trains will collide. Another Case: Distance between them is 200km.
10. Write a function such that if we pass 100 it returns 101 and if we pass 101 it returns 100 without if-else and ternary operator.
