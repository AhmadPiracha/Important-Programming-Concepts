### Analytical

1. **Measure 4L water from a jar of 3L and 5L**:
    - Fill the 5L jar and pour into the 3L jar, leaving 2L in the 5L jar.
    - Empty the 3L jar and pour the remaining 2L from the 5L jar into the 3L jar.
    - Fill the 5L jar again and pour into the 3L jar until it is full (leaving exactly 4L in the 5L jar).

2. **25 horses to find the top 3 in minimum races**:
    - Conduct 5 races of 5 horses each (5 races).
    - Take the top 5 horses from the 5 winners and race them (1 race). 
    - Total = 6 races.

3. **Total distance covered by the bird**:
    - Time taken for trains to collide = 160 / (80 + 80) = 1 hour.
    - Distance covered by the bird = 70 km/h * 1 hour = 70 km.

4. **Labeling 3 wrongly labeled bags in 1 try**:
    - Pick a ball from the bag labeled "Mix". This bag must contain only Red or Black balls. Label the bags accordingly based on this information.

5. **Pick 1 heavy ball from 8 balls in 2 attempts**:
    - Divide the balls into three groups of 3, 3, and 2.
    - Weigh the first two groups. If equal, the heavy ball is in the group of 2.
    - If unequal, the heavier group contains the heavy ball. Weigh two balls from the heavier group to find the heavy ball.

6. **50-story building and two boiled eggs**:
    - Use a binary search or drop the first egg from every 10 floors, then the second egg to pinpoint the exact floor.

7. **4 Pills and Blind person problem**:
    - Label the pills A, B, C, and D. Mix half of A with half of B, and half of C with half of D. Consume the mixed pills.

8. **Two candles to estimate 45 minutes**:
    - Light the first candle from both ends and the second candle from one end. When the first candle burns out (30 minutes), light the other end of the second candle. It will burn out in 15 minutes, totaling 45 minutes.

9. **Distance covered by the bird with new parameters**:
    - Distance between trains = 400 km
    - Speed of trains = 200 km/h each
    - Time to collide = 400 / (200 + 200) = 1 hour
    - Bird's speed = 393.75 km/h
    - Distance covered by the bird = 393.75 * 1 hour = 393.75 km

10. **Function to return 101 if passed 100 and vice versa**:
    ```python
    def foo(x):
        return 201 - x
    ```

11. **Transfer data from two databases to a fixed-size array**:
    - Use a balanced approach to distribute the

 data evenly between the array slots.

12. **Function to switch between 12 and 18 without if-else**:
    ```python
    def foo(x):
        return 30 - x
    ```

13. **Count the occurrence of a number in an array**:
    - Use a dictionary (hash map) to count occurrences in O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity.

### Miscellaneous

1. **Difference between PUT and PATCH**:
    - PUT: Replaces the entire resource.
    - PATCH: Partially updates the resource.

2. **What is a header in an HTTPS request**:
    - Headers are key-value pairs sent in HTTP requests/responses, providing information such as content type, encoding, and authentication details.
